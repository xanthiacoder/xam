Xanthia's Audio Manager for Mudlet

This script allows for easy management of audio assets for background and
sound effects. It is based on a proposed General BGM/SFX standard, like the 
General MIDI standard, in hopes of simplifying the process of adding an
immersive audio dimension to typically silent text games.
