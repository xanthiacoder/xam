XAMM was formerly "Xanthia's Audio Manager for Mudlet" and implemented at
the Cities Of M'Dhoria MUD. The previous description was as follows:

This script allows for easy management of audio assets for background and
sound effects. It is based on a proposed General BGM/SFX standard, like the 
General MIDI standard, in hopes of simplifying the process of adding an
immersive audio dimension to typically silent text games.

Project demos for the old scope may be found on this YouTube channel:
